# 2889. Reshape Data: Pivot

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to pivot the data so that each row represents temperatures for a specific month, and each city is a separate column.

## DataFrame Schema

**DataFrame: weather**

| Column Name | Type   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| city        | object |
| month       | object |
| temperature | int    |

## Example 1

### **Input:**

```plaintext
+--------------+----------+-------------+
| city         | month    | temperature |
+--------------+----------+-------------+
| Jacksonville | January  | 13          |
| Jacksonville | February | 23          |
| Jacksonville | March    | 38          |
| Jacksonville | April    | 5           |
| Jacksonville | May      | 34          |
| ElPaso       | January  | 20          |
| ElPaso       | February | 6           |
| ElPaso       | March    | 26          |
| ElPaso       | April    | 2           |
| ElPaso       | May      | 43          |
+--------------+----------+-------------+
```

### **Output:**

```plaintext
+----------+--------+--------------+
| month    | ElPaso | Jacksonville |
+----------+--------+--------------+
| April    | 2      | 5            |
| February | 6      | 23           |
| January  | 20     | 13           |
| March    | 26     | 38           |
| May      | 43     | 34           |
+----------+--------+--------------+
```

### **Explanation:**
The table is pivoted, each column represents a city, and each row represents a specific month.

## Constraints
- The function should return a DataFrame where each city becomes a column.
- The month column should remain as rows.
- The temperature values should be correctly assigned.
