# 2880. Select Data

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to select the `name` and `age` of the student with `student_id = 101`.

## DataFrame Schema

**DataFrame: students**

| Column Name | Type   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| student_id  | int    |
| name        | object |
| age         | int    |

## Example 1

### **Input:**

```rb
DataFrame students
+------------+---------+-----+
| student_id | name    | age |
+------------+---------+-----+
| 101        | Ulysses | 13  |
| 53         | William | 10  |
| 128        | Henry   | 6   |
| 3          | Henry   | 11  |
+------------+---------+-----+
```

### **Output:**

```rb
+---------+-----+
| name    | age | 
+---------+-----+
| Ulysses | 13  |
+---------+-----+
```

### **Explanation:**
The student `Ulysses` has `student_id = 101`, so we select the `name` and `age`.

## Constraints
- The `student_id` column is unique.
- The function should return only the row where `student_id = 101`.
