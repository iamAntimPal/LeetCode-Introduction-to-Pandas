# 2888. Reshape Data: Concatenate

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to concatenate these two DataFrames vertically into one DataFrame.

## DataFrame Schema

**DataFrame: df1**

| Column Name | Type   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| student_id  | int    |
| name        | object |
| age         | int    |

**DataFrame: df2**

| Column Name | Type   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| student_id  | int    |
| name        | object |
| age         | int    |

## Example 1

### **Input:**

```plaintext
**df1**
+------------+---------+-----+
| student_id | name    | age |
+------------+---------+-----+
| 1          | Mason   | 8   |
| 2          | Ava     | 6   |
| 3          | Taylor  | 15  |
| 4          | Georgia | 17  |
+------------+---------+-----+

**df2**
+------------+------+-----+
| student_id | name | age |
+------------+------+-----+
| 5          | Leo  | 7   |
| 6          | Alex | 7   |
+------------+------+-----+
```

### **Output:**

```plaintext
+------------+---------+-----+
| student_id | name    | age |
+------------+---------+-----+
| 1          | Mason   | 8   |
| 2          | Ava     | 6   |
| 3          | Taylor  | 15  |
| 4          | Georgia | 17  |
| 5          | Leo     | 7   |
| 6          | Alex    | 7   |
+------------+---------+-----+
```

### **Explanation:**
The two DataFrames are stacked vertically, and their rows are combined.

## Constraints
- The function should return a single DataFrame with all rows from `df1` and `df2`.
- The column names and order must remain the same.
