# 2886. Change Data Type

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to correct the errors:

- The `grade` column is stored as floats, convert it to integers.

## DataFrame Schema

**DataFrame: students**

| Column Name | Type   |
| ----------- | ------ |
| student_id  | int    |
| name        | object |
| age         | int    |
| grade       | float  |

## Example 1

### **Input:**

```plaintext
+------------+------+-----+-------+
| student_id | name | age | grade |
+------------+------+-----+-------+
| 1          | Ava  | 6   | 73.0  |
| 2          | Kate | 15  | 87.0  |
+------------+------+-----+-------+
```

### **Output:**

```plaintext
+------------+------+-----+-------+
| student_id | name | age | grade |
+------------+------+-----+-------+
| 1          | Ava  | 6   | 73    |
| 2          | Kate | 15  | 87    |
+------------+------+-----+-------+
```

### **Explanation:**
The data type of the column `grade` is converted to `int`.

## Constraints
- The `grade` column should be modified exactly as specified.
- The function should return the modified DataFrame with updated data type.
